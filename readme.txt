A Ludum Dare 25 game
48h compo entry
Theme: You are the villain

-----------------------------------------
Language: Object Pascal
Recommended compiler: Free Pascal Compiler

The release versions (both Win32 and Linux) have been compiled 
using FPC 2.6.0, but I've been able to compile it with 2.4.4.

I haven't been really using any features new to the compiler,
so I think that even older versions should be able to build
the game quite eagerly.

-----------------------------------------
The game uses SDL (event handling + gfx), BASS (sound) and Sour libraries.

Simple DirectMedia Layer

BASS by Un4seen Developments

Sour is my own handiwork and can be downloaded from my site.

-----------------------------------------
No, I'm not joking. It's that dead-since-always language, Pascal.
Well actually, Pascal, despite not being to popular in business,
has quite a large userbase, so contrary to what many C-users might
be thinking, it's far from being dead.

Okay, enough ranting. The code, as you can expect from a game made
for a 48h compo, is quite crappy. Since this is a post-compo version,
some cleanup has been made, functions have been moved, comments have
added. But it's still far from being state-of-the-art, so don't
expect me to cover the damage if you hurt your eyes looking at it.

You can use this code anyway you please, with the following exceptions:
- making an improved version of the game
- using some parts in a commercial product
Any of these two happening is close to impossible, but oh well, I like
to be prepared. Anyway, in the aforementioned cases - please contact me.

Other than that, feel free to read, observe, and despair. I mean, learn.
Like, you know, I made a game and you didn't, so you can learn from me.
Yeah.
